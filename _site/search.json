    "text": "Welcome to “JB: The New Frontier?”\n\n\nOur project aims to answer the following questions:\n\nWhat factors influence the real estate market in Johor Bahru?\nHow are different housing types clustered?\n\n\n\nJohor Bahru (JB) is generally seen as an accessible and low-cost shopping and dining haven for neighbouring Singaporeans. With housing prices in Singapore skyrocketing of late, many Singaporeans have turned to JB to seek cheaper housing, driving the local economy but also bringing with them unprecedented inflationary pressures.\n\n\n\n\nThe JB: The New Frontier? application is a Shiny web-based tool designed to assist users in analysing property prices and Points of Interest (POIs) within Johor Bahru, Malaysia, and the neighbouring suburb of Kulai to the north. By integrating geospatial data and interactive visualisations, the application enables users to explore property price patterns, assess their proximity to key amenities, and make well-informed decisions about property purchases. With features like base maps, hexagon grid analysis, and spatial statistical tools, users can identify districts of interest, uncover pricing trends, and evaluate properties based on type, price, and accessibility. This comprehensive platform ensures a data-driven approach to property investment in JB.\n\n\n\n\nTo enable non-specialists to use geospatial analytics to understand and predict real estate trends, empowering better investment decisions in Johor Bahru.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInteractive Maps: Visualise property prices and distribution using various mapping techniques, including base maps, hexagon grids, and local statistical analysis.\nPOI Mapping: Filter and analyse Point of Interests (POIs) by category to assess proximity factors influencing property prices.\nProperty Data Overview: Explore detailed property transaction data, including type, price, and location.\nGeospatial Insights: Leverage tools like Local Moran and Local Gi for understanding spatial dependencies and identifying clusters.\n\n\n\n\n\nBase Map Features: View property prices classified by methods and currency preferences, with additional property-specific information available via interactive clicks.\nHexagon Grid Analysis: Break down districts into smaller regions to analyse property density and price metrics (mean, median, maximum).\nSpatial Statistics: Use Local Moran and Gi analyses to detect significant clusters and hotspots of property pricing trends.\nCustomisable Filters: Narrow down analysis to specific property types or regions of interest for focused insights.\n\n\n\n\n\nDistrict Comparison: Compare property prices and amenities across districts to evaluate potential purchase locations.\nUser-Friendly Interface: Intuitive navigation tabs to simplify the exploration of property and POI data.\nActionable Insights: Provide data-driven recommendations to help users make well-informed property purchase decisions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following datasets were used for this prototype:\n\n\n\nData\nDescription\nSource\nProcessing method/tool used\n\n\n\n\nJohor Bahru, Malaysia Mukim boundary data\nGeographical boundary data for Mukims in Johor Bahru and Kulai\nUnited Nations Humanitarian Data Exchange (from geoBoundaries)\nFiltered away all districts except Johor Bahru and Kulai\n\n\nPoint of interest (POI) data\nNearby amenities, such as schools, parks, shopping malls and CIQ checkpoints, to properties\nOpenStreetMap\nOSM Overpass Turbo API was used to extract POI data for Johor Bahru and Kulai\n\n\nProperty transaction data, 2023-2024\nProperty transaction data for Johor Bahru and Kulai\nPortal Pusat Maklumat Harta Tanah Negara - Department of Valuation and Property Services, Malaysia\nExtract relevant data within Johor Bahru and Kulai, drop null values\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring a townhall presentation on 18 November 2024, we received some feedback and recommendations by our peers and members of the public, such as the following:\n\n“App takes a very long time to load”\n“When buying a property, I would have already considered roughly where I want to buy.”\n“Comparing against the whole JB seems irrelevant…”\n“Confused on what the ‘hedonic’ part tell me”\n“As a user/Singaporean, wouldn’t I be more interested in the price of property within a region than the factors affecting the price” -&gt; questioning the relevance of ‘hendonic pricing model’ to our project objective\n\n\nBased on the feedback given, we modified our application to be more user friendly and less complex, to achieve our objective of empowering non-specialists to make better investment decisions in Johor Bahru using geospatial analytics. The following are the changes made in response:\n\nAllow user to filter by district (Mukim) and analyse the property trends [This addressed the concerns raised by test users on speed and relevance of application to our project objective]\nRemoved the Hendonic pricing model and focusing more on the explanatory analysis of Exploratory Spatial Data Analysis (EDSA), Local Indicators of Spatial Association (LISA) and Hot and Cold Spot Analysis. [To allow user to make use of the analysis for more informed decision when buying a property in JB]\nChanges to the user interface of the application to make the application more user friendly, even for first-time and low technical proficiency users."
