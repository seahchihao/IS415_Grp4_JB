# JB: The New Frontier? {.center_heading1}

![](/images/logo.png){fig-align="center" width=45%}

<p style="text-align: center;">Welcome to "JB: The New Frontier?"</p>

---

Our project aims to answer the following questions:

- What factors influence the real estate market in Johor Bahru? 
- How are different housing types clustered?  

## **Context**

**Johor Bahru** (JB) is generally seen as an accessible and low-cost shopping and dining haven for neighbouring Singaporeans. With housing prices in Singapore skyrocketing of late, many Singaporeans have turned to JB to seek cheaper housing, driving the local economy but also bringing with them unprecedented inflationary pressures.

---

## **Summary of Application**

The ***JB: The New Frontier?*** application is a Shiny web-based tool designed to assist users in analysing property prices and Points of Interest (POIs) within Johor Bahru, Malaysia, and the neighbouring suburb of Kulai to the north. By integrating geospatial data and interactive visualisations, the application enables users to explore property price patterns, assess their proximity to key amenities, and make well-informed decisions about property purchases. With features like base maps, hexagon grid analysis, and spatial statistical tools, users can identify districts of interest, uncover pricing trends, and evaluate properties based on type, price, and accessibility. This comprehensive platform ensures a data-driven approach to property investment in JB.

---

## **Objective**
To enable non-specialists to use geospatial analytics to understand and predict real estate trends, empowering better investment decisions in Johor Bahru.

---

## **Key Features**

### **1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

- **Interactive Maps**: Visualise property prices and distribution using various mapping techniques, including base maps, hexagon grids, and local statistical analysis.
- **POI Mapping**: Filter and analyse Point of Interests (POIs) by category to assess proximity factors influencing property prices.
- **Property Data Overview**: Explore detailed property transaction data, including type, price, and location.
- **Geospatial Insights**: Leverage tools like Local Moran and Local Gi for understanding spatial dependencies and identifying clusters.

### **2. Property Price Analysis**

- **Base Map Features**: View property prices classified by methods and currency preferences, with additional property-specific information available via interactive clicks.
- **Hexagon Grid Analysis**: Break down districts into smaller regions to analyse property density and price metrics (mean, median, maximum).
- **Spatial Statistics**: Use Local Moran and Gi analyses to detect significant clusters and hotspots of property pricing trends.
- **Customisable Filters**: Narrow down analysis to specific property types or regions of interest for focused insights.

### **3. Decision-Making Support**

- **District Comparison**: Compare property prices and amenities across districts to evaluate potential purchase locations.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive navigation tabs to simplify the exploration of property and POI data.
- **Actionable Insights**: Provide data-driven recommendations to help users make well-informed property purchase decisions.

## **Data and Methodology**

The following datasets were used for this prototype:

| Data | Description | Source | Processing method/tool used |
| -----| ----------- | ------ | --------------------------- |
| Johor Bahru, Malaysia Mukim boundary data | Geographical boundary data for Mukims in Johor Bahru and Kulai | [United Nations Humanitarian Data Exchange](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/geoboundaries-admin-boundaries-for-malaysia) (from [geoBoundaries](https://www.geoboundaries.org/simplifiedDownloads.html)) | Filtered away all districts except Johor Bahru and Kulai |
| Point of interest (POI) data | Nearby amenities, such as schools, parks, shopping malls and CIQ checkpoints, to properties | [OpenStreetMap](https://download.geofabrik.de/asia/malaysia-singapore-brunei.html) | [OSM Overpass Turbo API](https://overpass-turbo.eu/) was used to extract POI data for Johor Bahru and Kulai |
| Property transaction data, 2023-2024 | Property transaction data for Johor Bahru and Kulai | [Portal Pusat Maklumat Harta Tanah Negara](https://napic2.jpph.gov.my/ms/data-transaksi) - Department of Valuation and Property Services, Malaysia | Extract relevant data within Johor Bahru and Kulai, drop null values 

The following analyses were performed:

- Exploratory data analysis (EDA): to visualise and easily understand the datasets to work with.
- Hexagonal grid density calculation: for easier calculation of Local Moran's I and Local Gi* statistics.
- Local Moran's I and LISA analysis: to discover locations with higher and lower aggregated property prices.
- Hedonic pricing model: to discover and analyse the impact of different nearby amenities on property prices in JB.

## **Results in brief**

Property prices within Johor Bahru are at their highest closer to the economic centres of Iskandar Puteri (within the mukim of Pulai) and Bandar Johor Bahru where the causeway is located. Based on the hedonic pricing model, proximity to schools, unlike in Singapore, turned out not to have a significant impact on property prices in Johor Bahru.

## **Changes made since townhall presentation**
During a townhall presentation on 18 November 2024, we received some feedback and recommendations by our peers and members of the public, including the following:

- "*App takes a very long time to load*"
- "*When buying a property, I would have already considered roughly where I want to buy.*"
- "*Comparing against the whole JB seems irrelevant...*"
- "*Confused on what the 'hedonic' part tell me*"
- "*As a user/Singaporean, wouldn't I be more interested in the price of property within a region than the factors affecting the price*" -> questioning the relevance of 'hendonic pricing model' to our project objective

---

Based on the feedback given, we modified our application to be more user friendly and less complex, to achieve our objective of empowering non-specialists to make better investment decisions in Johor Bahru using geospatial analytics. The following are the changes made in response:

- Have users view local Moran's I and local Gi* statistics as filtered by Mukim rather than for the entire map. This addresses concerns raised by test users on loading speed and relevance of our application to our project objective
- Removal of the hedonic pricing model from the application and focusing more on the explanatory analysis of Exploratory Spatial Data Analysis (EDSA), Local Indicators of Spatial Association (LISA) and Hot and Cold Spot Analysis. This allows users to make use of the analysis for more informed decisions when buying a property in JB
- Changes to the user interface of the application to make the application more user friendly, even for first-time and low technical proficiency users.
